Goals

1.  Understand and apply the principles of scrum: The team should aim to understand the principles of scrum, including roles, events, and artifacts. 
    We should implement these principles throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure effective project management, collaboration, and 
    continuous improvement.

2.  Learn from feedback and adapt to changes: The team should aim to learn from feedback and adapt to changes throughout the software development lifecycle.
    We should seek feedback from team members and use it to improve the product and the sprint process. We should also be open to changes in project 
    requirements and adjust their approach accordingly, while keeping the project on track and within the sprint timeline.

Work Expectations

1.  Time Commitments

    It is expected that each member of the Scrum team will commit to a certain amount of time each week for the project (variable according to availability). 
    This time commitment includes not only the time spent on completing tasks, but also time spent on attending meetings, collaborating with other team members, 
    providing feedback, and participating in other project-related activities.

2.  Differences in Work Habits

    The work habits of any particular member will not be an issue as long as the member communicates progress, produces quality work, 
    and the work is done by the dates established by the group. If the member does not meet these standards, procedures to deal with that 
    member are further detailed in the ground rules.

Ground Rules

1.  Meetings

    a.  General
    
    A meeting should generally take up to 1 hour. A meeting may take longer but it is discouraged. One meeting a week is required though the 
    group may schedule additional if scheduling allows. Meetings are to facilitate communication and establish direction for the project going forward.
    Beyond the scheduled time of a meeting members are free to leave to prevent conflicting obligations without incurring any offenses.
    
    b. Missing a Meeting
    
    It is permissible for someone to occasionally miss a meeting, but if an individual misses a meeting repeatedly without a valid reason, 
    disciplinary measures may need to be taken. Valid reasons for missing a meeting include but are not limited to illness, injury, family emergency, work, 
    conflicting class schedules, or a death of oneself or someone else. If someone misses a meeting for any other reason, the group members affected will 
    decide whether or not disciplinary action is necessary. Missing two meetings without a valid excuse sent by email will result in a minor offense, 
    while missing three meetings without a valid excuse will result in a major offense.
    
    c. Tardiness to Meetings
    
    A person who is late (i.e. greater than 5 minutes), within reason, will constitute a minor offense. If there is no good excuse for 
    being late and the meeting is clearly underway when the individual arrives then at the end of the meeting it will be discussed as 
    to whether disciplinary action will have to be taken. Being late to a meeting more than once constitutes a minor offense.
    
    d. Phone Use During Meetings

    Phones should not be used during meetings outside of emergencies. If someone frequently takes phone calls during meetings, 
    their behavior will be questioned and they will be asked politely to stop. If the behavior continues, the group will discuss 
    whether it should be considered a minor offense. It is permissible to check a text message or send a text to inform someone 
    that you are in a meeting and will get back to them. However, texting for social reasons will not be allowed, and if someone 
    engages in this behavior, they will be asked politely to stop. If the behavior continues, the group will discuss whether 
    it should be considered a minor offense.
    
    e. Food and Drink

    Given our meetings are virtual there are no restrictions so long as its consumption is not disruptive to the meeting. 
    If an individual’s food consumption is disruptive during a meeting, they will be politely asked to be less disruptive. 
    If it continues, they will be given a warning. If disruptive eating continues week after week, food may be banned at 
    meetings via a majority decision by the group. After the first warning it will constitute a minor offense.
    
2.   Group Communication

    a.  General 
    
    Regular communication should occur once a week outside of the scheduled meeting time via email or teams. This communication should include 
    a simple update on one's progress of their portion of the project. If a member forgets to post progress, any member can send an inquiry 
    email to the person who forgot. If the email is not responded to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that 
    member’s responsibilities through the decision making process stated in part e of this section. If a member fails 
    to respond, disciplinary action will be taken unless they have a valid reason for not responding, in which case it 
    will be considered. If the member responds within 24 hours and states that they forgot, no disciplinary action will 
    be taken. However, if there is no response and no valid reason is given, it will be considered a minor offense right away.
        
    b.  Communicating Absences/Conflicts
        
    If a member has prior knowledge of a missed meeting or tardiness that member shall send an email to all group members signifying such. 
    Failure to do so more than once will result in a minor offense.
       
    c.  Communication Ethics
    
    All group members must acknowledge and respect the opinions and input of each individual member, 
    even if they don't agree with them. No member or their opinions should be degraded or dismissed, 
    and all opinions should be given equal consideration. If a member feels that their opinions are being rejected unfairly, 
    they have the right to bring up the issue with the group leader and/or the group as a whole. The group will 
    then discuss the situation and either reconsider their opinions or provide reasons why the member's opinions cannot be used. 
    If such disagreements occur repeatedly, any team member may raise the issue with the TA (Teaching Assistant). 
    Further escalation may be necessary depending on the circumstances.

    d.  Group Decisions
    
    Decisions regarding the project, project direction, or disciplinary action will be made through a majority vote. 
    Matters related to delegation will be discussed in part e.

    e.  Delegation
    
    The group will discuss and decide on responsibilities together, after which each member 
    will have the chance to volunteer for the tasks they prefer. Refusal to volunteer for any task 
    will be considered a major offense. If a group member believes that their share of the responsibilities 
    is unfair, they may raise their concern and provide reasons for it. If a majority of the group agrees with the 
    member, the responsibilities will be reevaluated, and the delegation process will begin anew.

3.   Participation and Work Quality

    a.  General
    
    If a group member isn’t participating or is over participating it will be up to the rest of the group to politely ask the member 
    to share either more or less based on the situation.
    
    b.  Work Quality
    
    It is possible that at some point during the project, a member may be unable to dedicate the necessary 
    time and effort to meet the group's standards. If this occurs, the member should inform the group as soon 
    as possible so that the task can be reassigned according to the established decision-making and delegation process, 
    and the group can maintain its productivity. If the member continues to repeat this behavior, it may result in 
    a minor or major offense, depending on the severity of the situation. In any case, the individual must be given a minor 
    offense for this action before a major offense can be assigned. At some point, the group may decide not to offer work to 
    the member anymore, as they are deemed untrustworthy. However, the member may be able to regain the group's trust by
    performing above expectations for at least two weeks, at which point they will be restored to full member status.
    
    c.  Preparedness
    
    If the group as a whole perceives that a member is unprepared for a meeting and their lack of preparation 
    creates an obstacle for the group and project, disciplinary action will be necessary. This type of unpreparedness 
    will result in a warning initially, and subsequently be considered a minor offense.

    d.  Excessive Work Loads
    
    If the time constraints and the number of group members actively participating are insufficient to complete a task, 
    a request for an extension will be sent to Rock via email and in person. The request will include details of the 
    amount of work remaining, the progress made so far, and the reasons why the task cannot be completed within the given time period.

4.  Disciplinary Procedures

    a.  General 
    
    Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group consensus, if decided by a majority vote.
    
    b.  Disciplinary Log
    
    A dedicated member will be responsible for logging offenses committed by any member. 
    This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each member knows where they stand.
    
    c.  Minor Group Offense
    
    A minor group offense can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. A record of the offense will be recorded by the dedicated member.

    d.  Major Group Offense
    
    A major group offense can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for accumulation of 3 or more minor offenses. 
    The member is then on probation and their probation status is to be clearly documented by email. 
    They may return to regular group member status upon a group consensus. If they commit another offense constituted as either 
    minor or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal.

    e.  Punishment and Dismissal
    
    A group member committing enough minor and major offenses They will be referred to punishment and dismissal and will 
    be given over to review by the TA and Rock. An email describing the offenses leading up to punishment and dismissal will 
    be displayed along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of offenses.

We, the team named Scrum Squad agree with the Group Charter and will try our best to uphold it.
